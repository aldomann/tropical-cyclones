# Tropical-cyclones

My bachelor's thesis (with [Alvaro Corral](http://www.crm.cat/en/About/People/Researchers/acorral/Pages/PersonalContact.aspx?ItemId=CO000207) as my thesis supervisor) consists of the study of hurricanes; both statistical and real occurrences, and comparison with some simple model of self-organized criticality. 

The scripts are used to replicate the analyses and figures from *Scaling of tropical-cyclone dissipation* [1].
